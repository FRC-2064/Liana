# Liana - FRC Control Board

Liana is a Flutter-based control board application designed by 2064, originally to be used for the 2025 season, expanded to be evergreen.

### Why?
The goal of Liana, originally refered to as Control Board, was to give the operator a virtual button board. Due to our approach in the 2025 game year, our robot changed shape many times throughout the season. This would have made it difficult to build a physical button board, as we would either have to wait til close to our first competition to create it, a time in which time is at an all time low, or creating something that handled every situation and was not used fully.

Although [Elastic](https://github.com/Gold872/elastic-dashboard) has the ability to update network tables with buttons, having more customization with the canvas means that we can create more expressive layouts.

### 2025 Layout Example
